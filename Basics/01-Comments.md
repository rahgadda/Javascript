## Comments

- Comments are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand. These are ignored by compilers and interpreters.
- Javascript supports two types of comments similar to Java Programing language.  
   `\\Single line comment`
  `/*`  
   `This is a multi line comment`  
   `Add other text in line 1`  
   `Add other text in line 2`  
   `*/`
